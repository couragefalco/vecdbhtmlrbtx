Schmalz GmbH £1,348.20 End effectors End effectors are the functional unit that is attached to the flange of each robot and with which the movement to be automated is executed. The functional unit can be either a gripper, a workpiece or measuring/testing equipment . This is how Andreas Pott and Thomas Dietz define it in their book Industrielle Robotik, Springer Verlag. At times, robots perform handling or pick-and-place tasks to a large extent in an industrial context. Mostly, therefore, robot grippers are used for end effectors. At RBTX, you can perform a compatibility check before you buy an end effector. To do this, simply place the robot you are using and your preferred end effector in the MyRobot configurator. The configurator will then tell you if your products are compatible.

"Automatic dispensing system for pharmacies Products Solutions Machine Planner Get free expert advice Help GB Home Products Solutions Machine Planner Get free expert advice Help Contact Us FAQ & Articles 1 / 4 Automatic dispensing system for pharmacies Qx Robotics Pvt. Ltd Health Pick & Place Show all photos Low cost desktop medicine dispensing machine Hardware Price : £9,061.33 pick-rate 12 per minute ROI 1 month Volume > 55 dB The job of a pharmacist is to advise their customers on their medication. Pharmacists spend a lot of time fetching medications. How convenient it would be if it wasn't the pharmacist coming to the medication, but the medication coming to the pharmacist. Qx Robotics' medication dispenser is designed to do just that. There are already a number of medication dispensing solutions. These solutions are often very expensive and prohibitively expensive for the many smaller pharmacies. Qx Robotics is focused on working in this sector. The main goal is to offer pharmacies an affordable solution. The Qx-Dextron is a tabletop medication dispensing device. It can dispense medication strips (blister type, aluminum-aluminum, etc.) as well as medication boxes. The system can dispense medications much faster, freeing up time for the pharmacist to spend more time with the customer. The solution is based on a compact pick-and-place robot. Conventional automation solutions for pharmacies can dispense boxes. With its innovative design, Qx-Dextron can dispense more difficult-to-handle products such as drug push-through packs (aluminum-aluminum). The actuation system of the Qx-Dextron is based on an XYZ gantry system from igus. The advantages The product can speed up dispensing. For pharmacies, the time required for dispensing medications drops to less than one-third of the conventional process. The product is cost-efficient. Due to the cost-effective automation system, it can pay for itself in the pharmacy within one year. The Dextron's custom electronics make it energy efficient. The power consumption of the Qx-Dextron averages less than 1 kWh per day. The dimensions of the product can be customized according to customer requirements. The system is also stackable and space saving. 2 Components £9,061.33 Show Components Bundle Composition Room Linear Robot - Stepper Motors with Encoder, Working Space 500x500x100 mm igus £8,715.53 Vacuum gripper sample kit mounting plate eberle £345.80 Add Bundle to Cart Book a free video call If you need a custom configuration, you can talk to one of our experts.

It often starts at 30,000 €. The upper limits are open. The high price is a barrier to entry for smaller companies to buy industrial robots and start automating their businesses. But there are also robots available at low cost. Through manufacturers that focus on simple automation solutions and innovative, low-cost materials. As a result, small and medium-sized companies also reap the benefits. RBTX bundles this offer of low-cost grippers , cameras and all accessories for industrial robots in the online store. Buying industrial robots - the agony of choice For many people, the thought of a robot conjures up the image of a powerful jointed-arm robot that moves entire cars, for example. But robots look different. Depending on the application, a decision must be made as to which type of robot, also known as kinematics, is to be used. Tip: It is particularly difficult for automation beginners to assess which robot is suitable for their project. The RBTXpert will advise you on your individual application in a free video chat. Regardless of which robot you ultimately decide on, in any case industrial robots have advantages that cannot be overlooked and are superior to manual work: high repeatability and precision, no signs of fatigue, and they are a real alternative in times of a shortage of skilled workers.

"""ChocoMatic"" the automatic chocolate dispenser Products Solutions Machine Planner Get free expert advice Help GB Home Products Solutions Machine Planner Get free expert advice Help Contact Us FAQ & Articles 1 / 6 ""ChocoMatic"" the automatic chocolate dispenser Roose Automation Food Pick & Place Show all photos A delicious pick and place application operated by end users directly. Hardware Price : £18,177.55 Project costs 25000 GBP ROI 8 Months Operation 24 Hours The development project ""ChocoMatic"" is an automatic chocolate selection device with an igus robot arm. It is mounted on an igus guide. The customer controls a robot with a tablet or his own smartphone, which compiles the individual selection for the customer from a pallet of different chocolates and places it in a box. These applications are all about interaction between the customer and the robot. The employees of the store where a robot has been set up do not need any training and do not have to perform any difficult tasks. The robot works completely ""on its own"", all you have to do is refill the chocolates and press the start button. The robot is equipped with a camera and takes pictures of all the chocolates. From the data, it automatically learns where the different types of chocolates are located. The robot also measures the height of each type of praline. This information is later used when filling a box of chocolates. For each praline requested by the customer, a picture is first taken to determine the exact position of the praline. It is then picked up exactly in the center and placed in the box. The robot also takes into account the position of each praline in the box. It will therefore not immediately place the ""difficult"", round chocolates in the box, but will first determine a sequence in order to then decide when it is best to deposit these chocolates. If a certain type of chocolate is no longer available, the customer cannot select it and employees are notified and asked to refill that type of chocolate. The setup provides excellent service to the customer and is very easy for employees to use. Technical expertise is not required. The robolink series from igus has two advantages: There are no expensive licenses to pay, which often threaten the profitability of the product with their annual recurring costs. The robolink robot arm's small size and light weight make it ideal for a wide range of smaller applications. This design serves mainly as a tourist attraction in chocolate stores and museums that live mainly from tourism. On the other hand, it can also reduce the cost of such business. The employees can fully concentrate on the customer's wishes and help him further, while the customer assembles a box of chocolates and gives orders to the robot. In addition, this automatic chocolate counter is also more hygienic because the chocolates do not come into contact with people and are placed directly in the box. 5 Components £18,177.55 Show Components Bundle Composition CobotPump (Mini) for electrical vacuum generation schmalz £1,462.72 Object Recognition Sensor - Standard Lens 18x14 ifm £1,421.70 Robolink DP - 5 Degrees of Freedom, Reach 790 mm igus £11,159.97 drylin® 7th axis for robolink DP igus £3,947.99 Energy Chain Set for igus Robolink DP igus £185.17 Add Bundle to Cart Book a free video call If you need a custom configuration, you can talk to one of our experts.

"Automated quality assurance with robots Products Solutions Machine Planner Get free expert advice Help GB Home Products Solutions Machine Planner Get free expert advice Help Contact Us FAQ & Articles Automated quality control – Testing more efficiently and cost-effectively from £8,674 What is automated quality control? Definition and importance in modern manufacturing With an automated quality control repetitive inspection processes can be carried out efficiently and precisely using robots. The application scenarios are as varied and individual as the work processes to be automated. Modern production facilities are characterised by both inline and end-of-line automated quality control. Advantages of automated quality assurance Inspection processes can be efficiently streamlined through the use of machines and also offer many advantages: Identical test sequences : To obtain comparable results, test sequences must always be carried out according to an exactly identical scheme. Robots ensure identical procedures and precise, consistent measurement of the inspection characteristic. Increase productivity : Robots can be used around the clock without compromising quality. Unlike humans, they show no signs of fatigue. Reduce costs : With low-cost plastic robots, automation projects have proven that they pay for themselves in as little as 3-6 months. Ensuring reliability : There is no need for absences due to illness or capacity. This improves the plannability of tasks and resources in quality control. Avoiding perceptual errors : Human behaviour, or human perception, is constantly changing. This lack of consistency leads to varying results in quality inspection, which affect the final product. The use of robots prevents this problem. Which applications can be automated in quality assurance? Whether surface inspection, dimensional inspection or functional inspection - inspection processes and inspection characteristics differ greatly in practice. The following scenarios illustrate how flexibly modern robots can be used for quality assurance tasks: Scenario 1: Loading and unloading a test station This robot solution made by Four Stars Engineering takes over the automated loading and unloading of a test station for printed circuit boards of different sizes. A defective board is automatically sorted out. Add to cart: robolink DP + energy chain + controller + vacuum gripper £11,059.41 Scenario 2: Automatic optical quality control/visual inspection The watches from Certina are checked for their minimum run time. A camera controls the individual clocks to visually check whether the minute and second hands are moving. Add to cart: surface gantry + control system + camera £8,674.55 Scenario 3: Automated random inspection Benning performs with this robot a contact test on a measuring device and automatically passes the data to a quality management system. Add to cart: robolink DP + energy chain + controller + vision sensor £11,281.17 Which robot types are suitable for performing automated quality control? The selection of a suitable robot depends on the respective application. Cost-effective – Pick-and-place applications to move parts physically Fast – Gripping of parts precisely and quickly, e. g. from conveyor belt Flexibel – Loading of machines or measuring and testing stations Fit for the future with automated quality controls The possible applications for automated quality controls are very diverse. Thanks to low-cost robots, various application scenarios can be realized flexibly and individually. The RBTXpert service supports those willing to automate in their plans to find a feasible and cost-effective solution .

The important question in this application is how long the watch was turned and how long it ticks afterwards. The Certina company checks in its automated quality control, among other things, whether the watches reach the minimum running time. For this purpose, they use a xyz gantry from igus and a camera. With this, all watches can be approached individually and checked via camera image. The advantage of the xyz gantry is that it is lubricant-free, so that the clocks are not contaminated. And the adaptability of the dimensions of the gantry. 2 Components £8,298.21 Show Components Bundle Composition Flat Linear Robot - Stepper Motors with Encoder, Working Space 300x300 mm igus £6,876.51 Object Recognition Sensor - Standard Lens 18x14 ifm £1,421.70 Add Bundle to Cart Book a free video call If you need a custom configuration, you can talk to one of our experts.

"Safely protected in case of fire Products Solutions Machine Planner Get free expert advice Help GB Home Products Solutions Machine Planner Get free expert advice Help Contact Us FAQ & Articles 1 / 5 Safely protected in case of fire Vetrotech Saint-Gobain Kinon GmbH Manufacturing Pick & Place Show all photos Low cost automation of the production of fire-resistant glass with Delta robots from igus Hardware Price : £14,863.84 Project costs 15000 GBP ROI 12 Months Pick rate 30 Picks per minute Plastic components are picked up from a feed unit by the Delta robot in combination with the suction cup and placed in a picking matrix. The maximum pick rate is 30 picks/min. Vetrotech Saint-Gobain Kinon GmbH is a leading international supplier of high-tech and safety glass for public facilities and marine applications. In addition to bulletproof and explosion-proof glass, the company manufactures fire-resistant glass. To make the production of these glasses even faster and more reliable, the company now relies on robot technology. For example, a Delta robot from igus is used for sorting bulk material on predefined pallets. The production process used to be as follows: First, the plastic arrows are placed in predefined molds, then picked up by a robot and positioned as placeholders. Placing the arrows in the molds was previously done by manual labor. The monotonous work was performed by an employee who did this task on the side. This was an additional burden, so a new solution had to be found that on the one hand relieved the employee, was cost-effective and achieved reliable results. The result is improved work quality with a short payback period. The automation solution relieves employees and at the same time speeds up production processes. As a result, employees can use their free capacities for more demanding activities. But the improved quality of work was not the only incentive to automate. The low-cost robot pays for itself, determined by a fast ROI. With three shifts a day, each with one employee sorting the filling corners for three hours, the project pays for itself in terms of costs after twelve months. 3 Components £14,863.84 Show Components Bundle Composition Pneumatic rotary feed-through igus £833.19 Object Recognition Sensor - Wide Angle Lens 36x27 ifm £1,421.70 Delta Robot - Pre-Assembled, Working Space Diameter 360 mm igus £12,608.95 Add Bundle to Cart Book a free video call If you need a custom configuration, you can talk to one of our experts.

"Pick and place robots for automated processes Products Solutions Machine Planner Get free expert advice Help GB Home Products Solutions Machine Planner Get free expert advice Help Contact Us FAQ & Articles Pick and place robots for automated processes from £11,723 What is a pick and place robot? A pick and place robot transports an object from location A to location B. These are often repetitive and time-consuming activities that still offer a lot of optimization potential within a production. However, pick-and-place systems are increasingly found in everyday end-user applications, such as vending machines. Which applications can be automated with the help of a robot? Pick and place robots can be used for the following applications, for example: Machine loading Palletizing Sortation Automated quality control Gluing and dosing Pre-assembly Different robot types such as jointed-arm robots, delta robots or gantry robots can realize a wide variety of application scenarios depending on the pick-and-place task. The flexibility in the choice of kinematics therefore makes it possible to respond to individual requirements. If you are unsure about which robot is best suited for an application, it is worth talking to a robotics expert without obligation. Examples of pick and place robots Example 1: Bin Picking A challenge for the robot, but not impossible: picking unsorted parts. Add to cart: xyz gantry + Formhand vacuum gripper + robobrain.vision + energy chain set + accessories £44,105.57 Example 2: Medication Time-consuming picking out of medications is a thing of the past: A gantry system picks up medications to transport them to the dispenser. Add to cart: xyz gantry + vacuum gripper + ejector + energy chain set £13,188.25 Example 3: Lab assistent The SCARA robot has a steady hand and handles the test tubes with precision. Add to cart: Scara robot + small parts gripper £11,723.22 What are the requirements for the pick and place robot? Check in advance exactly what the requirements are for the robot to avoid a bad investment. In the best case, coordinate your application with an experienced robotics expert. Consider these 7 criteria when planning your automation solution: Degree of freedom: independent movement capability Reach: maximum working range of the robot, measured from the origin of the robot in the coordinate system Payload: load that can be moved without reducing the robot's speed Precision: accuracy with which the part to be moved is always placed in the same location Cycle time: describes the process speed at which an operation is repeated Motor control: electronics that control and monitor the motor function Gripper: tool with which the part to be moved is gripped and deposited. You can download a detailed checklist for the requirements test of your robot here. > Download checklist What components does a robot consist of? The elementary building blocks of a robot are: Motor Cables Energy chains Control system Software Linear guide or swivel joints Grippers Industries in which automation by robots is already common practice The pioneers in terms of automation are the automotive industry and mechanical engineering. However, the advantages of robotics, especially low-cost automation made of inexpensive plastic, have triggered an automation trend in industries ranging from agriculture and the food industry to medical technology and handicrafts.
